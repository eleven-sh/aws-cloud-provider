## Usage

```console
To begin, create your first sandbox using the command:
	
  eleven aws init <sandbox_name>
	
Once created, you may want to connect your editor to it using the command: 
	
  eleven aws edit <sandbox_name>
	
If you don't plan to use this sandbox again, you could remove it using the command:
		
  eleven aws remove <sandbox_name>

Usage:
  eleven aws [command]

Examples:
  eleven aws init eleven-api --instance-type m4.large 
  eleven aws edit eleven-api
  eleven aws remove eleven-api

Available Commands:
  edit        Connect your editor to a sandbox
  init        Initialize a sandbox
  remove      Remove a sandbox
  serve       Allow TCP traffic on a port
  uninstall   Uninstall Eleven
  unserve     Disallow TCP traffic on a port

Flags:
  -h, --help             help for aws
      --profile string   the configuration profile to use to access your AWS account
      --region string    the region to use to access your AWS account

Use "eleven aws [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### Authentication

In order to access your AWS account, the Eleven CLI will first look for credentials in the following environment variables:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`

- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

If not found, the configuration files created by the AWS CLI (via `aws configure`) will be used.

#### --profile

If you have configured the AWS CLI with multiple configuration profiles, you could tell Eleven which one to use via the `--profile` flag:

```shell
eleven aws --profile production init eleven-api
```

**By default, Eleven will use the profile named `default`.**

#### --region and AWS_REGION

If you want to overwrite the region resolved by the Eleven CLI, you could use the `--region` flag:

```shell
eleven aws --region eu-west-3 init eleven-api
```

```shell
eleven aws --profile production --region eu-west-3 init eleven-api
```

or the `AWS_REGION` environment variable:

```shell
export AWS_REGION=eu-west-3
```

**The `--region` flag takes precedence over the `AWS_REGION` environment variable.**

### Permissions

Your credentials must have certain permissions attached to be used with Eleven. See the next sections to learn more about the actions that will be done on your behalf.

### Authorized instance types

To be used with Eleven, the chosen instance must be **an on-demand linux instance (with EBS support) running on an amd64 or arm64 architecture**.

#### Examples

```shell
t2.medium, m6g.large, a1.xlarge, c5.12xlarge...
```

## Infrastructure components

![The AWS infrastructure created](./assets/aws_infra.png)

The schema above describe all the components that may be created in your AWS account. The next sections will describe their lifetime according to your use of the Eleven CLI.

### Init

```bash
eleven aws init eleven-api
eleven aws init eleven-api --instance-type t2.medium
```

#### The first time Eleven is used in a region

When running the `init` command for the first time in a region, a DynamoDB table named `eleven-config-dynamodb-table` will be created. This table will be used to store the state of the infrastructure.

Once created, all the following components will also be created:

- A `VPC` named `eleven-vpc` with an IPv4 CIDR block equals to `10.0.0.0/16` to isolate your infrastructure.

- A `public subnet` named `eleven-public-subnet` with an IPv4 CIDR block equals to `10.0.0.0/24` that will contain the instances running your sandboxes.

- An `internet gateway` named `eleven-internet-gateway` to let the instances communicate with internet.

- A `route table` named `eleven-route-table` that will allow egress traffic from the instances to the internet (via the internet gateway).

#### On each init

Each time the `init` command is run for a new sandbox, the following components will be created:

- An `EC2 instance` named `eleven-${SANDBOX_NAME}-instance` with a type equals to the one passed via the `--instance-type` flag **or `t2.medium` by default**.

- A `network interface` named `eleven-${SANDBOX_NAME}-network-interface` to enable network connectivity in the instance.

- An `Elastic IP` named `eleven-${SANDBOX_NAME}-elastic-ip` to let you access the instance via a fixed public IP.

- A `security group` named `eleven-${SANDBOX_NAME}-security-group` to let the instance accepts `TCP` connections on served ports.

- An `SSH key pair` named `eleven-${SANDBOX_NAME}-key-pair` to let you access the instance via `SSH`.
    
- An `EBS volume` attached to the instance (default to `16GB`) to provide long-term storage.

### Edit

```bash
eleven aws edit eleven-api
```

When running the `edit` command, nothing will be done to your infrastructure.

### Serve

```bash
eleven aws serve eleven-api 8080
eleven aws serve eleven-api 8080 --as api.eleven.sh
```

When running the `serve` command without the `--as` flag, an `ingress` rule will be added to the `security group` of the instance running your sandbox. 

This rule will allow all `TCP` trafic from `any IP address` to the specified port.

**When the `--as` flag is used, nothing is done to your infrastructure**.

### Unserve

```bash
eleven aws unserve eleven-api 8080
```

When running the `unserve` command, the `ingress` rule added by the `serve` command will be removed.

### Remove

```bash
eleven aws remove eleven-api
```

When running the `remove` command, all the components associated with the sandbox will be removed.

In other words:

- The `EC2 instance`.

- The `network interface`.

- The `Elastic IP`.

- The `security group`.

- The `SSH key pair`.

- The `EBS volume`.

### Uninstall

```bash
eleven aws uninstall
```

When running the `uninstall` command, all the components shared by your sandboxes **in the resolved region** will be removed. 

In other words:

- The `route table`.

- The `internet gateway`.

- The `public subnet`.

- The `VPC`.

- The `DynamoDB table`.

## Infrastructure costs

The costs of running a sandbox on AWS are essentially equal to the costs of the `EC2` instance and the `EBS` volume:

- For the `EC2` instance, the price depends on the instance type chosen.

- For the `EBS` volume, Eleven uses the `General Purpose SSD (gp2)` type that will cost you ~$0.10 per GB-month.

All other components are free (or mostly free) given their limited usage.
